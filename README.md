These are my solutions to the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This year, I want learn more about rust, so I will be attempting to solve the puzzles using it.
My solutions might not be the most rusty out there, and will almost certainly not be the most efficient;
my main goal is to simply write some rust that passes the compiler and actually solves the problems.

I have decided implement it as a library with a command line solver that makes use of it.
The cli work as follows: `advent-of-code day input` where day is which day's puzzle you want to solve
and input is the path to a file containing the input for said puzzle.
